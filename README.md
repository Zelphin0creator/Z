# Z
Z is short for Zelphin, it is an interpreted programming language
The Z language was created by a child of 9 years old for children who want into programming
It is very simple and to use it is easy, I created it because I needed to type and do something with my life, even at a young age
I hope it satisfies your desires even as an adult who needs or wants to learn programming, Thank you for your support
